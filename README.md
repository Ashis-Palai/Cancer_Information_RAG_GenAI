# Project Title: Cancer Information Retrieval from External Data Sources using RAG and Gemini Pro LLM Models

Description:

This project demonstrates a novel approach to retrieving and processing cancer information from various external data sources, including HTML and PDF documents. It leverages the power of two cutting-edge language models:

RAG: A factual language model excels at generating summaries and providing concise answers to specific questions.
Gemini Pro LLM: A large language model skilled in understanding complex language and generating responses in different creative text formats.
Key Features:

Data Extraction: Extracts relevant information from diverse external sources, including factual and narrative content.
Information Synthesis: Uses RAG to summarize extracted information concisely and accurately.
Question Answering: Employs RAG to answer user queries directly and factually.
Creative Text Generation: Leverages Gemini Pro LLM to generate engaging text formats like news articles, poems, or scripts related to cancer information.
Benefits:

Comprehensive Access: Gathers information from various sources, providing a broader understanding of cancer topics.
Efficient Processing: Automates information extraction and summarization, saving time and effort.
Improved Accessibility: Presents complex information in clear, concise, and user-friendly formats.
Enhanced Engagement: Encourages user interaction and deeper learning through creative text generation.
