# Project Title: Cancer Information Retrieval from External Data Sources using RAG and Gemini Pro LLM Models

**Description:**

> Explore a cutting-edge approach to cancer information retrieval and processing from diverse external data sources, including HTML and PDF documents. This project leverages two powerful language models:

**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and Google Gemini Pro Models**

This innovative project aims to revolutionize cancer information retrieval, covering various types such as:
- Cervical Cancer
- Breast Cancer
- Oral Cancer
- Ovarian Cancer, and more.

Utilizing LangChain and Pinecone (Vector DB), we delve into the forefront of Generative AI with the RAG model and the capabilities of the Gemini Pro LLM.

üîç **Key Features:**

- **Data Extraction:** Collecting insights from diverse sources, including HTML and PDF documents.
- **Information Synthesis:** Utilizing RAG to distill extracted data into concise and accurate summaries.
- **Question Answering:** Empowering users to find answers to specific queries directly and factually.

üí° **Benefits:**

- **Comprehensive Access:** Offering a holistic view by gathering information from various sources.
- **Efficient Processing:** Streamlining information extraction and summarization for time-saving and initial idea before doctor consultation.
- **Improved Accessibility:** Presenting complex data in clear, concise, and user-friendly formats.
